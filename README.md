# 🔒 What is Hacking?

Welcome to **What is Hacking?** – A curated knowledge base where I document everything I learn about **hacking, cybersecurity, red teaming, and blue teaming**.  
This repository is part of my personal journey to master hacking and also to share knowledge with the community. 🚀

## 📌 What is Hacking?
**Hacking** is the practice of gaining unauthorized access to data, systems, or networks.  
It can be classified into different types:
- 🖤 **Black Hat** – Malicious hacking for personal gain or damage.
- ⚪ **White Hat** – Ethical hacking for security testing and defense.
- ⚫ **Grey Hat** – In between: sometimes ethical, sometimes not.
