What is Hacking?

Hey friends 
I’m Vishnu, a student who is learning about cybersecurity.

So, what is hacking?
Hacking simply means finding a way to make a computer, software, or system do something it wasn’t originally supposed to do.

Sometimes, hackers do it for bad reasons (like stealing data, money, or damaging systems).

But hacking can also be used for good reasons (like testing security, fixing problems, or protecting people online).

we have two main sides of hacking

Ethical Hacking (Good Guys) → Protect systems, find weak points, and fix them.

Malicious Hacking (Bad Guys) → Break systems, steal, or cause harm.

I’m learning only the ethical and legal way of hacking to become skilled in cybersecurity and help others stay safe.

In simple words
Hacking = Understanding how things work + Finding new ways to use them (good or bad)
